## Introduction

Lung cancer is a significant health concern globally, and early detection can significantly impact patient outcomes. This project aims to predict the risk of lung cancer using machine learning techniques. The model takes into account various demographic and health-related factors to provide an estimate of the likelihood of developing lung cancer.

## Features

The model predicts the risk of lung cancer based on the following features:

- **Demographic Information:**
  - Gender
  - Age
  
- **Health and Lifestyle Factors:**
  - Smoking history
  - Presence of yellow fingers (indicative of smoking)
  - Anxiety levels
  - Peer pressure related to smoking
  - History of chronic diseases
  - Fatigue levels
  - Allergies
  - Wheezing
  - Alcohol consumption habits
  - Frequency of coughing
  - Shortness of breath
  - Difficulty in swallowing
  - Presence of chest pain

The model outputs a probability score between 0 and 1, indicating the likelihood of developing lung cancer.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Streamlit web application for interacting with the lung cancer prediction model.
- `model.h5`: Trained TensorFlow model stored in HDF5 format.
- `label_encoder_gender.pkl`, `label_encoder_lungs.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`: Pickle files containing data preprocessing artifacts (label encoders and scaler).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the application.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project, its features, and usage instructions.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- `streamlit`: For creating interactive web applications.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `tensorflow`: For building and training the machine learning model.
- `scikit-learn`: For data preprocessing tasks.

Install dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lung-cancer-risk-prediction.git
cd lung-cancer-risk-prediction
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the lung cancer risk prediction tool.

3. Input the required details (gender, age, smoking habits, etc.) and click on the "Predict" button to see the predicted risk of lung cancer.

## File Descriptions

### `app.py`

This file contains the Streamlit web application code. It handles user inputs, preprocesses them, uses the trained model for prediction, and displays the predicted risk along with recommendations.

### `model.h5`

The trained TensorFlow model for predicting lung cancer risk. It takes preprocessed input data and outputs a probability score.

### `label_encoder_gender.pkl`, `label_encoder_lungs.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`

These pickle files store the preprocessing artifacts:
- `label_encoder_gender.pkl`: Label encoder for gender feature.
- `label_encoder_lungs.pkl`: Label encoder (if applicable) for lung-related categorical features.
- `scaler.pkl`: Scaler used to standardize numerical input features.

### `requirements.txt`

A list of Python packages required to run the application.

## Model Details

The model is built using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) implemented with TensorFlow. It has been trained on a dataset containing historical data on individuals' demographics, health conditions, and lifestyle factors, labeled with their lung cancer risk outcomes.

## Data Preprocessing

Input data undergoes preprocessing before being fed into the model. Categorical variables are encoded using label encoding, and numerical variables are standardized using the scaler saved in `scaler.pkl`.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate more advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods or deep learning architectures for improved accuracy.
- Enhance the user interface with additional features for better visualization and interpretation of results.
- Expand the dataset with more diverse and comprehensive data to enhance model generalization.
